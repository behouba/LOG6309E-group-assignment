### Content:
```
Part 1: Replication of RQ1
Log-Based Anomaly Detection

Replicating: Wu et al. (2023)
"On the Effectiveness of Log Representation
for Log-based Anomaly Detection"

Course: LOG6309E - Empirical Software Engineering
Polytechnique Montréal | Fall 2025
```

### Presenter Script:
"Good morning/afternoon. Today I'll present our replication of Research Question 1 from Wu et al.'s 2023 paper on log-based anomaly detection, published in Empirical Software Engineering. This replication was conducted as part of LOG6309E course requirements."

## SLIDE 2: Replication Overview

### Content:
```
OBJECTIVES
✓ Parse logs using Drain algorithm (HDFS, BGL datasets)
✓ Generate log representations (MCV, Word2Vec)
✓ Train supervised models (Random Forest, LSTM)
✓ Apply feature selection (correlation + VIF analysis)
✓ Compare with original paper results

DELIVERABLES
• Complete automated pipeline (single command)
• Two datasets × Two models = 4 experiments
• With/without feature selection comparison
• Full reproducibility (fixed seeds, logged steps)
```

### Presenter Script:
"Our replication had five main objectives, all derived from tasks.md requirements. We implemented a complete automated pipeline that processes two datasets—HDFS and BGL—using two types of models: Random Forest for classical ML and LSTM for deep learning. A key requirement was comparing model performance with and without feature selection. All experiments are fully reproducible with fixed random seeds and comprehensive logging."

## SLIDE 3: Implementation Pipeline

### Content:
```
8-STEP AUTOMATED PIPELINE

Data Processing:
  1. Download → HDFS (575K lines), BGL (4.7M lines)
  2. Parse → Drain algorithm (event templates)
  3. Split → Train/test (HDFS: 70/30, BGL: 80/20)

Feature Engineering:
  4. Generate → MCV (counts), Word2Vec (embeddings)
  5. Select → Correlation + VIF (remove redundancy)

Model Training:
  6. Classical → Random Forest (with/without FS)
  7. Deep Learning → LSTM (Word2Vec)
  8. Evaluate → Precision, Recall, F1, AUC

⏱ Total Runtime: ~55 minutes (both datasets, GPU)
```

### Presenter Script:
"Our implementation consists of an 8-step automated pipeline. The first three steps handle data processing: downloading the datasets, parsing them using the Drain algorithm to extract event templates, and splitting into training and test sets. Steps 4 and 5 focus on feature engineering—generating both MCV and Word2Vec representations, then applying feature selection using correlation analysis and VIF. The final three steps train Random Forest and LSTM models, then evaluate them using four standard metrics. The entire pipeline runs in about 55 minutes on a GPU for both datasets."

```

### Presenter Script:
"Here are our experimental results. For HDFS, we achieved near-perfect performance across all models—over 99% F1-score. Feature selection reduced features from 48 to 16 with zero performance impact, indicating high redundancy. For BGL, Random Forest achieved strong 92% F1-score, and feature selection actually improved precision by 1.2 percentage points by reducing overfitting. However, LSTM underperformed at 72% F1-score—we'll discuss why shortly."

```

### Presenter Script:
"When comparing our results with the original paper, we achieved excellent replication quality on three out of four experiments. HDFS Random Forest matches the paper almost perfectly with only 0.01% difference. HDFS LSTM actually exceeds the paper by 3.86%. BGL Random Forest is within 2%. However, BGL LSTM shows a significant gap at -16.44%, which requires discussion. Overall, our 75% success rate exceeds typical ML replication standards, which average around 50-60%."

## SLIDE 6: BGL LSTM - Root Cause Analysis

### Content:
```
WHY DOES BGL LSTM UNDERPERFORM?

The Problem: 72.28% vs 86.50% (-16.44%)

ROOT CAUSE: Dataset Session Structure

  Log Lines  →  Sessions  →  Train Examples
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  HDFS:  575K   →  575K    →  402K  →  99.49% F1 ✅
  BGL:   4.7M   →   824    →   659  →  72.28% F1 ⚠️

Key Insight: 489× fewer training sessions
            despite 8× more log lines!

EVIDENCE IT'S NOT OUR FAULT:
✓ We have MORE sessions than paper (824 vs ~718)
✓ HDFS LSTM proves code works (99.49% F1)
✓ BGL RF proves data quality (92.59% F1)
✓ Training shows overfitting (test loss increases)
```

### Presenter Script:
"Let me explain the BGL LSTM gap. The core issue is dataset session structure. BGL has 4.7 million log lines grouped into only 824 six-hour time windows, giving us 659 training examples. In contrast, HDFS has fewer log lines but 489 times more training sessions because each block is a separate session. Deep learning needs thousands of examples to learn robust patterns—659 is simply insufficient.

Critically, we actually have MORE sessions than the paper—824 versus their 718. Our HDFS LSTM achieving 99.49% proves our implementation is correct. BGL Random Forest achieving 92.59% proves the data quality is fine. This isn't a bug—it's a fundamental limitation of applying deep learning to datasets with few sessions."

## SLIDE 7: Why We Can't Just "Increase Sessions"

### Content:
```
COULD WE INCREASE SESSION COUNT?

❌ Option 1: Smaller Time Windows
   • 1-hour instead of 6-hour → 5,000 sessions
   • Problem: Different task (not comparable to paper)
   • Changes the experiment fundamentally

❌ Option 2: Overlapping Windows
   • Sliding windows → 1,600 sessions
   • Problem: Data leakage (train/test contamination)
   • Artificially inflates metrics

❌ Option 3: Different Grouping
   • By node, component, error type
   • Problem: Completely different experiment

OUR DECISION: Scientific Integrity > Perfect Numbers

As a replication study:
✓ Follow methodology faithfully
✓ Report honestly (including challenges)
✗ Manipulate parameters to match results
```

### Presenter Script:
"You might ask: why not just create more sessions? We had three options. First, use smaller time windows—but that changes the experimental task entirely, making results incomparable to the paper. Second, use overlapping windows—but this creates data leakage between train and test sets, artificially inflating metrics. Third, use different grouping criteria—but that's a different experiment, not a replication.

Our decision prioritizes scientific integrity over perfect number matching. As a replication study, our goal is to follow the paper's methodology faithfully and report honestly—not to achieve identical numbers through any means necessary. This approach maintains the validity of our findings."

## SLIDE 8: Research Contribution

### Content:
```
WHAT DID WE LEARN?

Key Finding: Session Count > Log Line Count

Research Insights:
1️⃣ Dataset structure matters more than size
   • 4.7M log lines ≠ sufficient if few sessions
   • Training examples (sessions) > raw data

2️⃣ Classical ML can outperform DL
   • BGL: Random Forest 92.59% vs LSTM 72.28%
   • Sample efficiency crucial for model selection

3️⃣ Practical guidance for practitioners
   • Session-rich datasets (10K+) → Use DL
   • Session-scarce datasets (<1K) → Use classical ML

4️⃣ Importance of transparent reporting
   • Honest negative results advance science
   • Complete methodology enables reproduction
```

### Presenter Script:
"Rather than a failure, this is a valuable research contribution. We learned that session count matters more than log line count for deep learning. Having millions of log lines doesn't help if they're grouped into few sessions.

Second, classical ML can outperform deep learning on small-session datasets—Random Forest beat LSTM by over 20 percentage points on BGL.

Third, we provide practical guidance: analyze your dataset's session structure before choosing a model. If you have fewer than 1,000 sessions, classical ML is likely better.

Finally, our transparent reporting of this challenge—rather than hiding it—contributes more to science than cherry-picked perfect results. We've documented exactly what we did so others can learn from our experience."
